# Introduction

Through rose tinted glasses, our scene is set on the streets of the Greater Seattle area where roving gangs of bicycle riding raccoons battle over territory to secure a consistent supply of the 3 most important things to _Procyon lotor_ when found in their "natural" urban habitat; sustenance, shelter, and high-end fixed-gear bike parts.



You play as one of these now-retired chain breaking raccoons, retelling stories of the old glory days to your grandkits around the trash-fire.
There are many reasons why you might have entered the lucrative and dangerous bike component game.
But whether you grew up in the streets as a parts peddler or this was only a temporary decrease in your stature, you were in a bad situation at the time and you really needed the cash.



One things for sure, the Chain Gangs didn’t look kindly on the thieves and vagrants they found trespassing in their territory.
So you were either already an established member in one of these gangs, “protected” by them in exchange for a hefty weekly quota of trash/bike parts, or simply new in town and just lucky enough to stay off the radar.



## How to Play Raccoontuers & Racketeers

The following sections will cover making your raccoons, establishing character relationships, and everything you need to know to start playing.



** **

**In order to play you will require:**



➼ **1d20** & a minimum of **10D6** for the group. (**IDEAL**: About 10D6 per player)

➼ **Pen/Paper** for each player.
** **



## 1. Raccoon Generation

### 1.1. Ability Scores

Roll 6d6 and assign one die to each ability:



●
**Literacy:** _“Ability to Read/Write”_
-- Read/write human, “Book Smarts”, etc.


●
**Mimicry:** _“Ability to Imitate”_
-- Speak Human, Ventriloquism, etc.


●
**Jugglery** _“Manipulation/Trickery”_
-- Carrying Off Schemes, Ruses, Lies, Disguises, “Street Smarts”, etc.


●
**Celerity:** _“Rapidity of Motion”_
-- Running, Climbing, Swimming, Jumping, Sleight of Hand, etc.


●
**Ferocity:** _“Propensity of Harm”_
-- Scratch, Bite, Maim, intimidate, etc.


●
**Rotundity:** _“Level of Roundness”_
-- Remain steadfast in adversity thanks to your generous roundness.



If you have 3 (or more) 1’s, then you may re-roll all 6D6 at once until you have less than 3.
If you roll all 6’s, then you also get to manually choose your 2 starting items.



### 1.2. Starting Items

You get 2 items at the beginning of the game, this number is simply due to the fact that you only have 2 hands.
Unless you find a creative way to carry more items, you can only carry 2 items for the rest of the game and will need to set them down to do other actions.



To select your starting items you must roll a 1D20 twice on the list below:

1. **BASEBALL BAT W/ NAILS:** This one seems pretty darn self-explanatory.

2. **CASSETTE TAPE:** A-Side is Queen’s Greatest Hits supposedly.

3. **FAKE ID:** Use this to buy booze & weed despite the fact you’re likely 2-3 years old, and a raccoon.

4. **BROOM:** The ultimate anti-raccoon weapon, also works against cars, people, and dogs.

5. **BROWN CARDBOARD BOX:** Multipurpose logistics and obfuscation device.

6. **SMART PHONE:** Call your friends, take pictures, browse the web!

7. **COUGH SYRUP:** Doesn’t work on coughs, but at least it’s a mild narcotic.

8. **GRAPPLING HOOK:** Perform sweet grapple tricks.

9. **BALLOON:** The kind you can use to float around… Until it pops!

10. **DOG MASK:** Pass yourself off as a dog, they’ll never suspect a thing!

11. **FAKE BEARD AND GLASSES:** Conceal your identity… Just ignore the tail.

12. **LUBE:** A solution to things sticking.

13. **ANIMAL CONTROL KEYRING:** Either dropped or stolen, these are the keys to raccoon Super-Max.

14. **LIT CIGAR:** How’s it staying lit? It’s seriously been that way for weeks...

15. **POLICE SIREN:** Makes noise and lights. Clears traffic temporarily.

16. **LEAD PIPE:** Helps you hit stuff harder. +1 against kneecaps & Romans.

17. **TURBO ROCKET:** One use per race (up to 3/day), +3 to speed. It’s not rocket science.

18. **DUCT TAPE:** A solution to things not sticking.

19. **BANANA:** Delicious! Also, other's might slip on the peel...

20. **HANDGUN:** A loaded Ruger LCP II chambered in .380 ACP that hold 6+1 rounds.



### 1.3. Background

Why did you, a raccoon, enter the dangerous and lucrative world of bike theft?
Are you a wide-eyed rookie or a grizzled veteran?
Was it for the money, the thrill, or do you just not know anything else?
Are you part of a Chain Gang?
Are you an undercover cop?
Who are your rivals & are they human?
Do they even know you exist?
What’s the conflict at the heart of you that spurs drama?
**Write a short origin story for your raccoon, and give them a name.**



### 1.4 Character Relationships

#### 1.4.1. Nemesis

This individual is the crux of your existence.
You will likely do anything to see that they fail.
This can range from something like a sibling rivalry or something much more insidious.
Maybe they killed your best friend.
Or maybe they’re a former ally who betrayed you.
Who ever they are, you think they really just suck.



Roll 1D20, a result of 1 means the player 1D6 seats to your left is your nemesis and a result of 20 means the player 1D6 seats to your right is your nemesis.
Any other result means your nemesis is an NPC of your creation.



Other than telling the GK, this is your secret to disclose as you like.
Though if your nemesis is another PR and they are aware of your existence, double check they are okay with doing the things you blame them for having done.
Other players personal agency is more important than your backstory.



#### 1.4.2. Associate

This individual is someone you work with that either owes you a **Debt** or vice versa.
The two of you must work together as associates until the debt is invoked or the owner of the debt no longer requires the assistance.



Roll 1D20, a result of 2 means the player 1D6 seats to your left is your associate and a result of 20 means the player 1D6 seats to your right is your associate.
Any other result means your associate is an NPR of your creation.



Then roll 1D6 to determine who owes who.
If the result is even, they owe you a favor.
If it’s odd, you owe them a favor.
_[If your associate is another PR, first inform them of this debt and then roll the 1D6 for who owes who in a place both of you can see.]_



## 2. Rules

### 2.1. General Actions - _“Ability Check”_

Roll a number of D6 equal to the relevant ability when you attempt an action.
If your action ties into your origin story, add a D6 to your roll.
If it ties into the central conflict in your origin story, add another.
Furthermore, you may add a D6 if you have an item relevant to your action.



Each D6 with 4+ generates one success, while each 1 generates one **Flub**.
Most simple tasks need only one success, but some difficult ones may require many more.
The GK must publicly announce this value once the tasks difficulty is set.
If you exceed the check by one success, you may narrate an additional minor effect that occurred as you succeeded. For each success beyond this, you gain one **Triumph**.



### 2.1.1. Flub

For each 1 on a D6 during a check, you generate one Flub, a global currency representative of your raccoons cumulative mistakes.
If a raccoon has more than **three Flub**, other Raccoons may spend their **Triumph** to invoke negative **Defects** on them.



### 2.1.2. Defects

**Defects** are negative traits that raccoons can invoke on others when a targets **Flub** is equal to 3 or higher.
They have a relevant ability and a value of severity equal number of **Triumph** spent on them (up to a maximum value set by the targets current **Flub**).
This maximum is treated as a total of all defects currently applied from the raccoon who invoked them.
This means each other raccoon may also invoke defects on the same target without interfering with one another.



Formatted as [(Relevant Ability)(Severity) - “Flavor Text”]



The severity is the number of dice they subtract before rolling ability checks of the relevant type.
You may give this whatever narrative flavor you like as long as it is temporary in nature.
(ex. [Celerity 2 - “Sprained Ankle”] would cost 2 Triumph points, require the target to have a minimum Flub level of 3 in order to invoke, and result in them subtracting 2 dice from any celerity checks until the defect is resolved).



### 2.1.3. Triumph

Triumph is a personal currency representative of your Raccoons cumulative successes.
You may use it at any time.



One point of Triumph may be redeemed to:

- Re-roll a D6 during a check.

- Add an major effect to a success.

- Add up to 2 minor effects to a check, successful or not.

- Inspire another player: +1d6 to their check.

- Distract another Player: -1D6 to their check.

- Invoke a level of Defect (up to the targets current Flub level).

- Remove a level Defect from yourself (down to your current Flub level).

- Lower your Flub level by one.



## 2.2. Vehicles

Vehicles require multiple Raccoons to operate them and have 3 stats; Top Speed, Durability, Complexity.



### 2.2.1. Vehicle Stats

Top Speed is the maximum number of speed dice.
Durability is the amount of damage it can withstand.
Complexity is the difficulty of the repair check.

---

There are 5 types of vehicles:



**Pedal-Powered:**

- Tricycle - Requires 1 Raccoon - [Top Speed: 5] [Durability: 5] [Complexity: 1]

- Bicycle, Child - Requires 2 Raccoons - [Top Speed: 10] [Durability: 7] [Complexity: 2]

- Bicycle, Adult - Requires 4 Raccoons - [Top Speed: 15] [Durability: 10] [Complexity: 3]



**Motor-Powered:**

- Motorcycle - Requires 3 Raccoons - [Top Speed: 30] [Durability: 15] [Complexity: 4]

- Automobile - Requires 5 Raccoons - [Top Speed: 50] [Durability: 20] [Complexity: 5]

** **

### 2.2.2. Operating the Vehicle

Players choose an action by secretly setting a D6 to a number of their choice, then revealing them all at once. **NO CONFERRING!**



Actions are carried out in order from lowest (1) to highest (6):

1: BRAKE: Speed -1 (-2 for cars)

2: TURN LEFT: About 30°

3: TURN RIGHT: About 30°

4: USE ITEM: Do something with an item

5: ACCELERATE: Speed +1 (+2 for cars)

6: ACTION! (Miscellaneous actions)



The GK moves the vehicle in accordance with the Raccoons’ collaborative actions.
The GK is the final arbiter of this; they also move the other vehicles around to react to what’s going on.



SPEED starts at 0. At the end of each round, the GK rolls D6 equal to speed.
For each dice that shows 1, the vehicle takes 1 damage.
For each dice that shows 4+ you get a success.



Spend successes as a group, with more successes achieving more difficult/impressive feats.



Options include:

- Streak ahead of rivals

- Run chumps off the road (if you’ve made contact with them)

- Do cool tricks, like jumps and skids

- Find, or create, a better route through the streets of Seattle

- Create an obstacle to block path.



### 2.2.3. Collisions & Damage

If the vehicle makes contact with an obstacle (or a wall) it takes damage if the GK feels it would be appropriate.
If it’s a glancing blow, or a breakable object, the car takes damage equal to half speed.
If it’s a head-on crash, or a solid object, it takes damage equal to speed, and speed is reduced to 0.



If your vehicle takes damage equal to (or higher) than it’s Durability, it ceases to operate until you repair it or find some other means of moving it.
If it takes any further damage without repair, results may be catastrophic.



## 2.3. Harm & Misfortune

If a Raccoon fails a dangerous action, they’re in trouble and must be assisted/rescued by their friends (or begrudging associates).
Player Raccoons don’t take serious damage or die, ever.
Otherwise they wouldn’t be here telling this story to their grandkits right now.
Instead of having harm befall them, another Raccoon may opt to rescue them, accruing a **Debt** for the Raccoon being assisted.



Harming humans, other animals, and Non-Player Raccoons though? That’s totally fair game…



## 2.4. Debt

A debt can only be invoked once and compliance to its demands are non-negotiable. It either is generated at the start of the game or accrued during play when being rescued from danger.
If the owner of the debt wishes, you must work together as their associate until the debt is invoked or the owner of the debt no longer requires the assistance.
If this association causes the indebted party to repeatedly endanger themselves, their family/friends, or their livelihood to a extreme level, then their debt may be considered absolved even if it was never directly invoked.
