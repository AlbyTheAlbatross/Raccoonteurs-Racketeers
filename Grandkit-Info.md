### 3.1. The Role of the Grandkit

There is no Game Master in R&R, instead you play as group of grandkits sitting around the trash-fire listening to their elders being braggadocios raccoonteurs, re-telling stories from their chain-breaking youth.
It’s up to you to keep their tales from getting out-of-hand by constantly asking questions to define, explain, or complicate things for the raccoonteurs.
Remember what it’s like to tell a rowdy group of children a story they don’t already know?
You're those children right now.



### 3.2. Play-Styles

While they’re are many ways to run your R&R game, the ideal start for new players is a Free-Form game where all the players begin in the same Chain Gang.



#### 3.2.1. Free-form

In a standard, Free-form game, the raccoontuers goals are abstract.
They will have personal goal defined by each player individually at creation and a group goal defined by the Grandkit.
Succeeding gets you closer to this goal, failing takes you further away. This is best for one-off games where bookkeeping is more of a nuisance.



#### 3.2.2. Variations

Other variants and optional rules can be found in section 5.2.



## 4. Grandkit Tips



### 4.1 Play it straight.

Don’t have anyone question the fact that Raccoon’s are doing this.
All of it is either considered absolutely normal to any aware bystanders, thought of as "someone else's problem”, or they have headphones on and refuse to make eye-contact with anything.



### 4.2 Be a fan of the Raccoontuers.

They are your elders and you're still at that point in your life where everything adults say is gospel.
They are you personal hero’s, so make it seem that way.



### 4.3. Ask questions 24/7 and use the answers.

Make your players build the world with their narrative.
They are in fact the ones supposed to be telling the story.
Pretend you are rowdy group of children hearing a story for the first time.
ASK ALL THE QUESTIONS.
ALL OF THEM.
THEN ASK THEM AGAIN.
You can even follow up your questions with more questions.



### 4.4. Give everyone a name, a personal goal, and a motivation.

Anytime the players come into contact with a NPC, write down their name, their personal goal, and their motivation for this goal.



### 4.5. Make environments expensive and destructible.

This is Seattle we are talking about.
You can think of some iconic locations such as Pike Place Market, Seattle Center, the Waterfront, or Bezos’ Balls that you would love to see destroyed in a frenzy of chrome and fur.
So make it happen, place obstacles (and targets) in the path of the raccoonteurs to avoid (or aim for) while they go on their escapades.



### 4.6. Spotlight everybody.

The raccoonteurs will each grow into a role eventually, some taking charge, while others tend towards support.
This is expected and encouraged, but it’s your job to continually rotate the spotlight amongst all the player’s, especially ones that are quiet and don’t pipe up as much as everybody else so that everyone has an opportunity to stand out if they want.
That being said, make sure they want it.
Some player’s aren’t very comfortable with the spotlight, so just work with them and try to find a good balance.



### 4.7. Sock ‘em right in the feels.

Don’t be afraid to sacrifice a favorite NPR, location, or item of the raccoonteurs in order to up the drama.
If the players really don’t want it to happen they can burn Triumph to change the outcome or just ask you not to do it if it actually bothers them.
At the table player agency trumps fun, which in turn, trumps a good story.
Take care of your players and they should take care of you.



## 5. Optional Rules & Play Variants



### 5.2.1. Random Chain Gang Affiliations

This variation randomizes Chain Gang affiliation at the start of the game rather than leaving it up to player decision.
This is great if there is an odd number of players and you don’t want anyone to feel left out when picking teams.
The last option also leads to fun double-crossing drama.



   To determine your affiliation, roll 1D6:

  1. Unaffiliated

  2. Gang 1

  3. Gang 2

  4. Gang 3

  5. Your Choice

  6. Your Choice + Roll Again



### 5.2.2. Partners

This variation is for groups with an even number of players. You can either let players pick pairs or randomize the process.
For random selection, the GM rolls 1D6; Even=Left & Odd=Right, 1&2=1, 3&4=2, 5&6=3.
The GM, after shifting 1-3 seats in the direction denoted by the roll, counts aloud around the table up to half the total number of players twice after.
Each player has to remember their number.
The other player with the same number as you is your partner.
At this point, each set of partners may roll on the Random Chain Gang Affiliation chart.



### 5.2.3. Alternate Play-Style Concept: Survival

This variation concept is intended for larger groups and long running games.
They will have personal goal defined by each player individually and a group goal defined by their Chain Gang based on the stats at the time.
There are 4 statistics relevant to your Chain Gang:



**Sustenance**

- Food & Water

- To make it through the winter without any raccoons in your community suffering from malnutrition.

**Resources**

- Bike/car parts, scrap metal/wood, etc

- To repair anything ranging from bikes to buildings

**Security**

- Shelter & Fortification

- To protect from other Chain Gangs and catastrophes.

**Morale**

- Luxury Items, Achieved Goals, and Narcotics

- To keep raccoons happy and functional.

- Sets Mood of Chain Gang & Tone of Story
